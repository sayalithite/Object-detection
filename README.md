# Object-detection
 The obeject detection project is performed using SSD(Single shot multibox detector)-MobileNetv3.MobileNet Deep learning algorithm is for image classification, SSD-Mobilev3 for Object detection which specifies the location of multiple objects in the image.
 # OpenCV
Once you visit on OpenCV official page,you will find many deep learning architecture as already pretrained models available and they are based on tensorflow.you can use opencv to load them. so the most recent one is mobilenet-SSD version 3. In the configuration you can see what is the configuration, what is the input size and lot of other informations available. you will get graph of deep learning architectutre in that.
